### Hey there! 👋

I’m **Bikram Banerjee**, a data engineer based in India.

I design and build data systems that turn raw information into reliable, usable insights.

If there’s a data problem — ingestion, transformation, orchestration, or scale — I enjoy figuring out how to make it efficient, maintainable, and production-ready.
